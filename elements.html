<h1>Solar system</h1>
<p> 
    The <b>Solar System</b> is dominated by the Sun and the planets that orbit around it.
    The planets consist of (in increasing distance from the Sun) Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
    Uranus, Neptune and, formerly, Pluto. The Solar System also consists of the moons that revolve around 
    some of the planets, asteroids, comets and meteors.
 The inner planets are small in size and have densities consistent with rock and metal compositions. 
    Thus, the planets <i>Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars </i> have broadly similar compositions and are 
    termed the Terrestrial planets. The outer planets are known as the Gas Giants because 
    of their relatively large size. They are largely composed of the gases hydrogen and
     helium and have lower densities than the <u>Terrestrial planets.</u>
