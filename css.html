    Instead of surveying the paper
     as a whole, you can count sentences within
      paragraphs. If so, all paragraphs should
       have between three and ten full sentences. 
       All in all, a strong and coherent paragraph
        starts and ends itself, and so there's no 
        need to count paragraphs when the argument
         is clear and directed.

    Animals are integral to our world, offering
    companionship and wonder. Pets like cuddly
     cats, energetic dogs, and serene fish are
      beloved by many. Cats often meow to 
      communicate and purr when they feel 
      safe and happy, while dogs bark to 
      express various emotions from 
      excitement to alertness.

    Snakes live in a wide variety of habitats
     including forests, swamps, grasslands, 
     deserts and in both fresh and salt water.
      Some are active at night, others during 
      the day. Snakes are predators and eat a
       wide variety of animals, including rodents,
        insects, birds' eggs and young birds.
