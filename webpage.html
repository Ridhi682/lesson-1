<h2>Facts about Elephants</h2>
<div>
<p>
    Elephants are truly remarkable creatures, known for their impressive size and intelligence.
     As the largest land mammals, African elephants can weigh up to 14,000 pounds, with males being the most massive.
      Despite their size, elephants are incredibly social and live in tight-knit family groups, led by a matriarch,
       the oldest female<br>. These groups are essential for survival, as elephants rely on one another for support, 
       protection, and knowledge. One of their most fascinating traits is their memoryâ€”elephants can remember
        other individuals and locations for decades, a skill that helps them navigate vast landscapes and find
         water sources in dry seasons. Their complex communication abilities, including vocalizations and
          seismic signals, also play a critical role in maintaining their social structures and
           coordinating group movements.
